Lets describe the microservices:

* `bookcatalogue` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn.

* `bookinventory` - It exposes an endpoint to check whether a book has sufficient stock to fullfil an order.  I uses a domain consisting of a stock level and isbn.

* `bookrecommendation` - It consumes previous services and exposes and endpoint which recommends book names which are in stock.

Initially we are going to hardcode the addresses where the different services are in the `bookcatalogue` service.

As shown in the previous image, the `bookcatalogue` hardcodes references to its collaborators.

In the second part of this tutorial we are going to use a discovery service.

The services register when they start up:

When a service wants to do a request to other service, it uses the discovery service to retrieve the address.
